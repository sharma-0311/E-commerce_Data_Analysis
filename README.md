# E-commerce_Data_Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing an e-commerce dataset to derive insights about sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance. The dataset is explored using Python data analysis libraries, and an interactive dashboard may be created using Power BI.

## Dataset
The dataset contains various attributes related to e-commerce transactions, including:
- **Order ID**: Unique identifier for each order
- **Product Name**: Name of the purchased product
- **Category**: Product category
- **Order Date**: Date when the order was placed
